We, or authorized third parties, automatically collect log data when you access and use the Platform, even if you have not created an account or logged in. We use this information to administer and improve the Services, analyze trends, track users' use of the Platform, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.Note that Device and Usage Information is collected from our community boards,.Based on Device and Usage Information, we are also able to determine general location information ("Location Information").

**Location Information:** we use a third-party database to map the general location to which each IP address corresponds ("Location Information"). The Location Information that is mapped from an IP address is limited to country and city – we do not identify precise location. We use Location Information in order to more effectively provide our Services to our Customers.
