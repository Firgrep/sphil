## Introduction to the Science of Logic

### The Familiar Logic

Logic is the systematic study of valid reasoning, inference, and argumentation. It deals with principles and rules that govern correct and consistent reasoning. In essence, logic provides a framework for evaluating the validity of arguments and determining whether conclusions logically follow from premises. It encompasses various branches, including propositional logic, predicate logic, modal logic, and mathematical logic, each with its own set of rules and applications.

At its core, logic involves analyzing statements or propositions and their relationships to ascertain whether they lead to a sound and coherent conclusion. It helps in distinguishing between valid and invalid forms of reasoning, facilitating clear and rational thinking across different domains, such as mathematics, philosophy, computer science, and linguistics.

This is logic as it is commonly known to us. In this vein, logic is like following certain rules when dealing with ideas. Imagine an idea to be a certain "block" and logic the "rules" for playing with "blocks" in a good way. Just like how you need to follow certain rules to build a stable and cool structure with your blocks, logic helps us figure out how to put our ideas together in a way that makes sense. For example, if you have a red block and a blue block, and someone says, "All red blocks are big," and you know the red block you have is small, you can use logic to figure out that the statement is not true for all red blocks. Hence, logic is like a set of rules that helps us understand if the things we say or think fit together properly, just like how blocks can fit together to build something, or, equally, blocks can be jumpled together into a pile with no innate consistency or structure.

These definitions of logic all fall short of the self-critical demand of philosophy. 

While for most ordinary and pragmatic pursuits, these definitions of logic work perfectly fine; as soon as the self-critical lens of philosophy is applied, it becomes readily apparent that there are incoherent gaps or unquestioned dependencies. A cursory inquiry exposes this: What is valid reasonig and argumentation? What grounds the principles and rules that govern correct and consistent thinking? How does a framework that is external to the issue it looks into have any real authority over that issue? What are the conditions for the possibility of rational thinking; is not *all* thinking, per definition, rational? Can a thought exist that is not rational?

This is why Hegel begins, in the introduction to *The Science of Logic* (SL), with the following statement:

> In no science is the need to begin with the fact [ *Sache* ] itself, without preliminary reflections, felt more strongly that in the science of logic (Hegel, 2010, 23/21.27).

The hindrance being thrown ahead is not so much that the functional definitions of logic are false or bad, but they are, taken as a whole, lacking or insufficient. And this is due to the peculiar turn thinking must take when engaged philosophically, namely, that the context itself is unbounded and thought is absolutely free in its pursuits.

### The Unfamiliar Logic

The philosophy of logic examines logic not merely in its parts and established definitions, but also as a whole and questions what has been established. To follow our toy example, in philosophy one is not only concerned with blocks and how they possibly fit together, but also "what is a block", what does it mean for blocks (or anything) "to fit together", how do blocks "emerge" or have they "always been there", or is it the *pattern* itself of how things fit that has always been there? When we apply this line of thinking to actual logic, our concern becomes, to use the example of syllogism: what is a syllogism, how are the major and minor premises constituted to create the conclusion, how do premises emerge or are they latent within one, is the syllogistic pattern mutable or immutable? Now apply this line of inquiry not to any particular logical rule, but to logic itself! Besides the intense inquiry into the nature of things, philosophy does not dismiss ordinary or familiar notions of logic (or any concept) but takes them seriously. Indeed, it is out of wonder and curiosity of *how* and *why* things work the way they work that first prompts one to investigate more closely.

The barrier that the familiar notion of logic had erected has begun to break down. It is understood inquiring into logic as a pre-established set of rules for reasoning, inference and argumentation prompts questions of justification when examined under a philosophical, unbounded lens. But one may decide at this point to hold on to these established notions and instead work backwards to discover a common foundation. Notice how this leaves precisely the core issue unattended, namely, the established concepts themselves! In pinning a certain logical idea and then setting out to inquire into its presuppositions leaves that very idea as *the* presupposition. For example, if one decides to inquire into the nature of propositions (S is P) by looking at what is the subject, what is the predicate and what is their connection, one takes no less for granted that there is such a thing as the proposition. But then what grounds the proposition as such? Here one can continue to attempt to pursue the same track by looking at constituents or presuppositions, or one can short circuit the line of inquiry itself and see that no pre-established, familiar idea will adequately answer the demand of self-critical thought. 

This is what Hegel has in mind when speaking of the _need to begin with the fact itself, **without preliminary reflections**_. In fully self-critical philosophy, where the context is unbounded (if it at all makes sense to speak of a context), one cannot take for granted any pre-established notion or logical set of rules such that one must make an _absolute beginning_. Indeed, taken to its extreme, this rigorous inquiry necesarrily purges not only the typical associations of familiar logic (rules, propositions, syllogism, etc.) but also the less standard ones such as reality, world, negation, certainty, truth, infinity, finitude, form, content, matter, thing, property and a host of others. These _categories_ are basically dropped, and, crucially, any sense of externality along with them. 

> In every other science, the matter that it treats, and the scientific method, are distinguished from each other; the content, moreover, does not make an absolute beginning but is dependent on other concepts and is connected on all sides with other material (Hegel, 2010, 23/21.27).

This senes of _absolute beginning_ requires one to think of logic not as relative to its subject matter, or as a certain form that merely structures some other content, but _being both at once_. At the outset of its inquiry, logic cannot be distinguished from its matter and it cannot be dependent on anything else but itself. 

This finally crumbles the initial edifice established by the familiar notion. In this presuppositionless thinking about logic, the decision has been taken to suspend the customary meanings of rules and laws of thinking, and thus upend the usual procedures and methodologies. With no established idea, category, method or notion, one strictly cannot declare in advance of its thinking what logic is or will be. "Logic, therefore, cannot say what it is in advance, rather does this knowledge of itself only emerge as the final result and completion of its whole treament. ...its concept is generated in the course of this elaboration and cannot therefore be given in advance" (Hegel, 2010, 23/21.27). No idea or concept can be pinned or established. Our blocks and their patterns melt away. Indeed, the very sense of logic vanishes.

### At the Beginning

One thus is, albeit highly expedited, transported to the place of absolute beginning, the place where the inquiry into logic can begin in earnest. Yet, at this point a final hurdle remains that bars the deployment of thinking positively what logic is and that is the problem of beginnings. More technically, it is the issue concerning the nature of beginnings which surrepticiously seem to pre-determine their ends. We see that echoes of a distinction between form and content, logic and its subject matter, persist. Doing philosophy of logic then is less a set procedure with definite steps as it is a continual refinement of distilling the adequate conceptions according to the skill of one's craft. This is owing in no small measure to the fact that logic and its actual thinking are deeply intertwined. But this does not diminish the idea of clear resolutions and definite determinations, but it does diminish the idea that that is all there is to logic. As it will be seen, logic is far more strange and wondrous than is usually given credit, and that logic in its full scope both contains and transcends a living, self-correcting evolution and is the universally eternal touchstone of truth.

> Only after a more profound acquaintance with the other sciences does logic rise for subjective spirit from a merely abstract universal to a universal that encompasses within itself the riches of the particular: in the same way a moral maxim does not possess in the mouth of a youngster who otherwise understands well the eaming and scope that it has in the spirit of a man with a lifetime of experinece, to whom therefore the weight of its content is expressed in full force. Thus logic receives full appreciation of its value only when it comes as the result of the eperience of the sciences; thne it displays itself to spirit as the universal truth, not as a _particular_ cognition _alongside_ another material and other realities, but as the essence rather of this further content (Hegel, 2010, 37/21.42).

## Other Predispositions Considered

Hegel considers a number of other typical approaches to logic and its relation to thinking. These help to further specify the determination of logic that Hegel intends to work with.

### Logic as Mere Form

When logic is considered as a science or knowledge of thinking, it is first understood that this thinking is "_the mere form_" of cognition that abstracts from all content (Hegel, 2010, 24/21.28). This has two consequences: Firstly, logic or thinking as mere form is completely devoid of any internal truth and acts merely as the stepping stone to another's. Secondly, logic is wholly dependent on extraneous matter to be given to it, for it itself consists only for _formal conditions_ and not of any _real truth_. Moreover, it can be seen here that logic is taken _externally_ to its subject matter, which holds latent a critical metaphysical assumption. As Hegel notes:

> Presupposed _from the start_ is that the material of knowledge is present in and for itself as a ready-made world outside thinking; that thinking is byitself empty, that it comes to this material as a form from outside, fills itself with it, and only then gains a content, thereby becoming real knowledge (Hegel, 2010, 24/21.29).
