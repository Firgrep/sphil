## General Division of the Logic

### The Major Divisions

_The Science of Logic_ is divided into two major parts or three doctrines. In accordance with the major parts, the _Logic_ is divided into _objective logic_ and _subjective logic_. The objective logic contains the doctrines _The Doctrine of Being_ and _The Doctrine of Essence_, and the subjective logic contains _The Doctrine of the Concept_. Each of these doctrines deal with the development of logic in what could be classed as predominant registers, such as immediate existence, mediated or reflected determinations and conceptual thought proper. In other words, each of these doctrines operate in ways that distinguish how logic behaves whether the matter is fundamentally immediate, mediated or a developmental integration of both. 

Hegel warns at the very start of the section General Division of The Logic&mdash;just following the Introduction&mdash;that these divisions between parts and doctrines do not serve to philosophically determine the content of logic ahead of time, but are rather preliminary aids to help orient the reader. They are, therefore, pedagogical in nature and the full disclosure of the actual development is only found in following each determination or concept carefully from its beginning to its end. 

With that in mind, one can quickly get a basic lay of the land and get a sense of the project's predominant moves. Hegel goes into brief description of each part and doctrine. Given that the logic will develop into `the concept`, whose logic is explicitly developmental, it becomes understood that the preceding doctrines are _moments_ of its development and are as such not as self-standing as they first were understood to be&mdash;indeed, Hegel's argument is that these categories or determinations are internally inadequate. This means that everything in the logic becomes oriented around the concept and, finally, `the idea`. 

> Therefore the earlier determinations which (on the _pathway to truth_) _existed for themselves_, as for instance, that of subjective and objective, or also of thought and being, of concept and reality, no matter from what standpoint they were determined, are _now in their truth_, that is, in their unity, _reduced to forms_. In their difference they therefore implicitly remain, _in themselves_, the whole concept, and this concept is posited in the division only under its own determinations (Hegel, 2010, 39/21.45).

_The objective logic_ concerns the determinations or concepts that are typically understood to exist immediately, such as `being`, `existence`, `quality`, `the one`, `the many` and so forth. In more technical terms, It is the concept _implicitly in itself_.

_The subjective logic_, on the other hand, concerns explicitly conceptual determinations, such as `universality`, `particularity`, `singularity`, `judgment`, `inference`, `means`, `purpose`, `cognition` and many more. This is the concept _that exists for itself_.

Now, this is essentially the first broad division of logic, but, as Hegel notes, being and the concept do not stand wholly apart from each other but are related. Indeed, their very difference logically establishes a link between the two. This reference constitutes a particular logic unto itself that is known as the sphere of mediation or _The Doctrine of Essence_. As Hegel elaborates:

> [The sphere of mediation is] the concept as a system of _reflected determinations_, that is, of being as it passes over into the in-itselfness of the concept &ndash; a concept which is in this way not yet posited for itself _as such_ but also fettered by an immediate being still external to it (Hegel, 2010, 40/21.46).

The _difference_ between being and thought necessitates a third element between them and so it is more precise to divide the logic into three doctrines rather than two parts. Hegel also notes that with essence the stalwart objectivity of being is progressively denigrated to include the inwardness of the concept; however, precisely for that very reason, the concept is unable to be made fully explicit while the immediacy of being persists. Essence is therefore the purgation of the concept, as it were, since the concept is actively failing to be the concept proper while being remains something immediately external to it and so must overcome these failures by the discovery of a logic that is not bound by mere difference. 

## Further Remarks

### On the Term Element

Hegel highlights the term _element_ when discussing the unity of the doctrines. As George di Giovanni notes in his translation, element has classical connotations harkening back to the four elements of "air", "water", "earth" and "fire" where it is understood that something has an underlying nature of its own _but also_ has implied  modes of being or relationships to other elements (Hegel, 2010, 39). In Aristotle, we find element defined as: 

> An element, we take it, is a body into which other bodies may be analysed, present in them potentially or in actuality (which of these, is still disputable), and not itself divisible into bodies different in form (Aristotle, 2001, On the Heavens, Book III, Chapter III). 

As far as Aristotle was concerned then, an element cannot be divided into bodies of a different form, such that if one were to divide "air", one would not receive "fire" or "earth". Whether this is still valid for Hegel is not clear here, but what is clear is that logic principally understood as element persists throughout its many divisions or transformations and is therefore _the_ unity. 

However, what might contrast to the thinking of element as a kind of "building block" is the fact that the logical developments of the concept are non-regressive. That is to say, the progression of thought cannot be reverted back to its constituents. As Hegel confirms:

> For since the division is ... the _parting_ or the _judgment_ of the concept &ndash; is the positing of the determination which is already immanent in it and therefore the positing of its distinction &ndash; this positing must not be understood as resolving that concrete unity back into its determinations, as if these were to exist on their own, for this would be here a vacuous return to the previous standpoint, to the opposition of consciousness. But this opposition has vanished; the unity remains the element, and the distinctions of the division and of the development in general no longer transgress that unity (Hegel, 2010, 39/21.45). 

Positing&mdash;here meaning putting something as explicit&mdash;develops the content further and reveals new details about it. This further account cannot be said to be part of the constituents as they were but must be part of them as they develop. In the context of thought and consciousness, the latter is oriented around an subject-object opposition whereas in thought, by contrast, this opposition has _vanished_, leaving logic as the sole element of which any further distinctions and classifications form moments.
