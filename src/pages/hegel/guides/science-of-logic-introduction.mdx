## Introduction to the Science of Logic

### The Familiar Logic

Logic is the systematic study of valid reasoning, inference, and argumentation. It deals with principles and rules that govern correct and consistent reasoning. In essence, logic provides a framework for evaluating the validity of arguments and determining whether conclusions logically follow from premises. It encompasses various branches, including propositional logic, predicate logic, modal logic, and mathematical logic, each with its own set of rules and applications.

At its core, logic involves analyzing statements or propositions and their relationships to ascertain whether they lead to a sound and coherent conclusion. It helps in distinguishing between valid and invalid forms of reasoning, facilitating clear and rational thinking across different domains, such as mathematics, philosophy, computer science, and linguistics.

This is logic as it is commonly known to us. In this vein, logic is like following certain rules when dealing with ideas. Imagine an idea to be a certain "block" and logic the "rules" for playing with "blocks" in a good way. Just like how you need to follow certain rules to build a stable and cool structure with your blocks, logic helps us figure out how to put our ideas together in a way that makes sense. For example, if you have a red block and a blue block, and someone says, "All red blocks are big," and you know the red block you have is small, you can use logic to figure out that the statement is not true for all red blocks. Hence, logic is like a set of rules that helps us understand if the things we say or think fit together properly, just like how blocks can fit together to build something, or, equally, how blocks can be jumbled together into a pile with no innate consistency or structure.

These definitions of logic all fall short of the self-critical demand of philosophy. 

While for most ordinary and pragmatic pursuits, these definitions of logic work perfectly fine; as soon as the self-critical lens of philosophy is applied, however, it becomes readily apparent that there are incoherent gaps or unwarranted dependencies. A cursory inquiry exposes this: What is valid reasoning and argumentation? What grounds the principles and rules that govern correct and consistent thinking? How does a framework that is external to the issue it looks into have any real authority over that issue if it is really external to it? What are the conditions for the possibility of rational thinking; is not *all* thinking, per definition, rational? Can a thought exist that is not rational?

This is why Hegel begins, in the introduction to *The Science of Logic* (SL), with the following statement:

> In no science is the need to begin with the fact [ *Sache* ] itself, without preliminary reflections, felt more strongly that in the science of logic (Hegel, 2010, 23/21.27).

The hindrance being thrown ahead is not so much that the functional definitions of logic are false or bad, but they are, taken as a whole, lacking or insufficient. And this becomes readily apparent when one thinks carefully through the questions that the established forms of logic prompt. Said otherwise, when one turns to think philosophically, the context itself becomes unbounded and thought is absolutely free in its pursuits.

### The Unfamiliar Logic

The philosophy of logic examines logic not merely in its parts and established definitions, but also as a whole and questions what has been established. To follow our toy example, in philosophy one is not only concerned with blocks and how they possibly fit together, but also "what is a block", what does it mean for blocks (or anything) "to fit together", how do blocks "emerge" or have they "always been there", or is it the *pattern* itself of how things fit that has always been there? When we apply this line of thinking to actual logic, our concern becomes, to use the example of syllogism (a pattern of inference): what is a syllogism, how are the major and minor premises constituted to create the conclusion, how do premises emerge or are they latent within one, is the syllogistic pattern mutable or immutable? Now apply this line of inquiry not to any particular logical rule, but to logic itself! Besides the intense inquiry into the nature of things, philosophy does not dismiss ordinary or familiar notions of logic (or any concept) but takes them seriously. Indeed, it is out of wonder and curiosity of *how* and *why* things work the way they work that first elicits one to investigate more closely.

The barrier that the familiar notion of logic had erected has begun to break down. It is understood inquiring into logic as a pre-established set of rules for reasoning, inference and argumentation induce questions of justification when examined under a philosophical, unbounded lens. But one may decide at this point to hold on to these established notions and instead work backwards to discover a common foundation. Notice how this leaves precisely the core issue unattended, namely, the established concepts themselves! In pinning a certain logical idea and then setting out to inquire into its presuppositions leaves that very idea as *the* presupposition. For example, if one decides to inquire into the nature of propositions (S is P) by looking at what is the subject, what is the predicate and what is their connection, one takes no less for granted that there is such a thing as the proposition. But then what grounds the proposition as such? Here one can continue to attempt to pursue the same track by looking at constituents or presuppositions, or one can short circuit the line of inquiry itself and see that no pre-established, familiar idea will adequately answer the demand of self-critical thought. 

This is what Hegel has in mind when speaking of the _need to begin with the fact itself, **without preliminary reflections**_. In fully self-critical philosophy, where the context is unbounded (if it at all makes sense to speak of a context), one cannot take for granted any pre-established notion or logical set of rules such that one must make an _absolute beginning_. Indeed, taken to its extreme, this rigorous inquiry necessarily purges not only the typical associations of familiar logic (rules, propositions, syllogism, etc.) but also the less standard ones such as reality, world, negation, certainty, truth, infinity, finitude, form, content, matter, thing, property and a host of others. These _categories_ are basically dropped, and, crucially, any sense of externality along with them. 

> In every other science, the matter that it treats, and the scientific method, are distinguished from each other; the content, moreover, does not make an absolute beginning but is dependent on other concepts and is connected on all sides with other material (Hegel, 2010, 23/21.27).

This sense of _absolute beginning_ requires one to think of logic not as relative to its subject matter, or as a certain form that merely structures some other content, but _being both at once_. At the outset of its inquiry, logic cannot be distinguished from its matter and it cannot be dependent on anything else but itself. 

This finally crumbles the initial edifice established by the familiar notion. In this presuppositionless thinking about logic, the decision has been taken to suspend the customary meanings of rules and laws of thinking, and thus upend the usual procedures and methodologies. With no established idea, category, method or notion, one strictly cannot declare in advance of its thinking what logic is or will be. Strictly speaking then, as Hegel says: "Logic, therefore, cannot say what it is in advance, rather does this knowledge of itself only emerge as the final result and completion of its whole treatment. ...its concept is generated in the course of this elaboration and cannot therefore be given in advance" (Hegel, 2010, 23/21.27). No idea or concept can be pinned, established or simply put before us. Our blocks and their patterns melt away. Indeed, the very sense of logic vanishes.

### At the Beginning

One thus is, albeit highly expedited, transported to the place of absolute beginning, the place where the inquiry into logic can begin in earnest. Yet, at this point a final hurdle remains that bars the deployment of thinking positively what logic is and that is the problem of beginnings. More technically, it is the issue concerning the nature of beginnings which surreptitiously seem to pre-determine their ends. We see that echoes of a distinction between form and content, logic and its subject matter, persist. Doing philosophy of logic then is less a set procedure with definite steps as it is a continual refinement of distilling the adequate conceptions according to the skill of one's craft. This is owing in no small measure to the fact that logic and its actual thinking are deeply intertwined. But this does not diminish the idea of clear resolutions and definite determinations, but it does diminish the idea that that is all there is to logic. As it will be seen, logic is far more strange and wondrous than is usually given credit, and that logic in its full scope both contains and transcends a living, self-correcting evolution and is the universally eternal touchstone of truth.

> Only after a more profound acquaintance with the other sciences does logic rise for subjective spirit from a merely abstract universal to a universal that encompasses within itself the riches of the particular: in the same way a moral maxim does not possess in the mouth of a youngster who otherwise understands well the meaning and scope that it has in the spirit of a man with a lifetime of experience, to whom therefore the weight of its content is expressed in full force. Thus logic receives full appreciation of its value only when it comes as the result of the experience of the sciences; then it displays itself to spirit as the universal truth, not as a _particular_ cognition _alongside_ another material and other realities, but as the essence rather of this further content (Hegel, 2010, 37/21.42).

## Other Predispositions Considered

Hegel considers a number of other typical approaches to logic and its relation to thinking. These help to further specify the determination of logic that Hegel intends to work with. The following issues are explored in more technical detail, but they all revolve around the core issue of logic being merely something external to concrete reality and formally dependent on it instead of being the self-determining essence of reality.

### Logic as Mere Form

When logic is considered as a science or knowledge of thinking, it is first understood that this thinking is "_the mere form_" of cognition that abstracts from all content (Hegel, 2010, 24/21.28). This has two consequences: Firstly, logic or thinking as mere form is completely devoid of any internal truth and acts merely as the stepping stone to another's. Secondly, logic is wholly dependent on extraneous matter to be given to it, for it itself consists only for _formal conditions_ and not of any _real truth_. Moreover, it can be seen here that logic is taken _externally_ to its subject matter, which holds latent an unquestioned metaphysical assumption. As Hegel notes:

> Presupposed _from the start_ is that the material of knowledge is present in and for itself as a ready-made world outside thinking; that thinking is by itself empty, that it comes to this material as a form from outside, fills itself with it, and only then gains a content, thereby becoming real knowledge (Hegel, 2010, 24/21.28).

Kantian undertones of blind intuitions and empty concepts can also be found in this assumption (although, to be fair to Kant, he was working from a different context)(Kant, 1998, 194/A51). The idea being that logic or thought are devoid of any truth _until_ material from the world (which itself is ready-made and complete unto itself) is given to it. 

The further consequence of this assumption is that logic and its subject matter (here the world) are utterly different from each other; "each turns out to be a sphere divorced from the other" (Hegel, 2010, 24/21.29). As Hegel notes, this leads exactly to the Kantian position of thing-in-itself, since logic or thought are utterly other to the world, the world is a complete thing unto itself logically prior it being given as material for cognition as intuitions. In other words, the world cannot be thought of with any certainty prior to its experience; or, put differently still, thought is incapable of coming to any resolution about its subject matter (be that the world, existence or anything).

If one pursues this line of thought further, then it effectively means that _thought is incapable of coming to any conclusions about itself_. Thought, as well as logic, are merely the formal instruments of experience that await reception of worldly material; prior to which thought is unable to think. Thought and logic in this view are _externally determined_, not _self-determining_. Put bluntly, then, according to this perspective thought cannot think. One does not make up one's own mind about something, but only ever reacts to certain sensuous data.

A further conclusion of this thread is that the world itself, or any subject matter of logic, is inherently _illogical_. This is the other side of that stark difference between logic and its subject matter. Since logic is mere form and this form requires material, the world cannot with any definitive resolution be understood to be logical _prior_ to its reception as material for cognition. We cannot speak of a reality outside experience. Hence, one is firmly placed in the Kantian position that posits the world _as such_ to be a _thing-in-itself_.[^1]

[^1]: It can be seen that just as thought is downstream from pure concepts and sensuous intuitions, the whole logic of the argument is itself heteronomous. Just as thought must assume worldly material given to it, so the transcendental argument itself turns around the world as given, despite positing its source as irrational.

Hegel notes that the manner one here views logic and its subject matter, thought and the world, subject and object, is in _phenomenal_ terms. But he calls it a prejudice to carry over this view into reason and logic. The argument is incoherent from the start since the phenomenal is allowed to make a metaphysical claim, but the former is exactly not the latter. The way one experiences things through the senses cannot be the standard for how everything is evaluated. Indeed, senses do not in the strict sense evaluate. This is not to say that experience is not real or important, but it is being misused if it is taken out of its scope. This miscarriage of logic is simply classed as an error and Hegel notes how it can be an impediment to philosophical thinking. 

> ...when these prejudices are carried over to reason, as if in reason the same relation obtained, as if this relation had any truth in and for itself, then they are errors, and the refutation of them in every part of the spiritual and natural universe is what philosophy is; or rather,since they block the entrance to philosophy, they are the errors that must be removed before one can enter it (Hegel, 2010, 25/21.29).

Curiously, the ancient thinkers, Hegel continues, had a higher conception of thinking since it was reasoned that only things known in thought, as opposed to known immediately, was understood to be the truth of the matter. It is, then, not what is _first_ experienced that is considered true, but what is _thought_ to be so. For example, in the distance an object may appear as a shipwreck but coming closer it becomes apparent that the object is actually a peculiar hut. Did the object itself morph between the two states? No, one reasons that perception gave a certain impression at one point and a different form another, but that the object had been what it was in both respects. One simply comes to _realize_ what the thing really was. Here thought is not alien to the world but is immanent to it, "the _things_ and the _thinking_ of them agree in and for themselves (also our language expresses a kinship between them)" (Hegel, 2010, 25/21.29). 

### The Conflict of Determinations

Hegel complains that the understanding has taken hold philosophy, and that, what is worse, ordinary common sense is granted dominion over the evaluating the truth about all things. Ordinary common sense being rooted in sensuous reality with the notion that thoughts are _only_ thoughts. Essentially, this view is uncritical and philosophically naive.

However, Hegel detects a more serious obstacle in this thinking when it is attempted to be philosophically applied. When, according to this naive position, thoughts are _only_ thoughts and that real knowledge is the intertwining of thoughtful form and worldly impressions, it can be easily missed that what are assumed to be conflicts of the world are really conflicts of ideas. In Hegel's more technical vocabulary, it is _the conflict of determinations_.

> The basis of the [conception of modern philosophy is] in the insight into the _necessary conflict_ of the determinations of the understanding with themselves. - The reflection already mentioned consists in _transcending_ the concrete immediate, in determining_ and _parting_ it. But this reflection must _equally transcend_ its _separating_ determinations and above all _connect_ them. The conflict of determinations breaks out precisely at the point of connection. This reflective activity of connection belongs in itself to reason, and to rise above the determinations ad attain insight into their discord is the great negative step on the way to the true concept of reason (Hegel, 2010, 26/21.30).

When logic is not considered on its own terms but merely in relation to sensuous existence, one fails to grasp that logic is in fact in conflict with itself. Discord and struggle are not exclusive to the domain of worldly reality but are also&mdash;perhaps more intensely&mdash;active in the domain of logic and reason. Philosophy disciplines the ability to distinguish what is proper to each domain and being able to understand when an apparent conflict belongs to worldly reality, the realm of pure logic or is an erroneous mismatch between the two.

Hegel notes a further error in the case where one is discouraged by a contradiction in the understanding and resolves to find accord and stability in sensuous reality. But, and here Hegel criticizes the Kantian transcendental standpoint once more, if one resolves to look to sensuous reality as the criterion of truth, in the same instance one cannot determine the thing in question to have _any_ independent truth since the truth of the matter is settled _only_ as it appears. "This is like attributing right insight to someone," Hegel writes, "with the stipulation, however, that he is not fit to see what is true but only what is false" (Hegel, 2010, 26/21.30). To put this another way, if by truth one understands a independent standard, then this immediately clashes with the knowledge through appearances, since knowing here is totally dependent on appearances and cannot make _any_ independent claims about the matter at hand. To emphasize this point further, if the transcendental arrangement is actually granted, then one cannot truly speak of laws of nature or even state that the sky is there the moment one turns one's gaze towards the ground. This is why, if Hegel is right, this claim that sensuous reality is the sole arbiter of truth leads to absurdity.

Finally, Hegel then points out that as the understanding (according to transcendental idealism) cannot apply its determinations or concepts to things in themselves, it must therefore mean that these determinations are in themselves something untrue and consequently cannot be turned upon itself or anything else related to pure reason. The standard set for the understanding is based on experience and empirical objects, but the categories that define these empirical objects are not themselves empirical&mdash;they are precisely pure&mdash;and so the categories of the understanding cannot apply to anything other than sensuous reality. But this is incoherent, since the categories themselves are pure, their validity cannot come from sensuous reality. "If they cannot be determinations of _the thing in itself_, still less can they be determinations of the _understanding_, to which one ought to concede at least the dignity of a thing" (Hegel, 2010, 27/21.31). In this Kantian regime, according to Hegel, one cannot consistently use the tools by which the understanding navigates the world to also navigate the realm of ideas and thoughts, with the result being that the understanding (or the mind) cannot be a thing, much less be said to exist.

The cause for this error, Hegel diagnoses, lies in the fact that the determinations or categories of the understanding were never given an independent examination and immanent deduction but were simply taken for granted.  

#### On the Absurdity of Knowledge Based on Appearances (Niklas)

Further observations may be drawn regarding the absurdity of truth vis-à-vis appearances (what we can call the double-standard of knowledge) in inspecting its implicit elements. When it is posited that knowledge is split by way of subject matters, and that of certain subject matters one can know nothing about (such as things-in-themselves) but others one can have knowledge (such as what appears in experience), knowledge remains the common element in both. The incoherence may be traced to an unstated third element that orchestrates the mediation between knowledge based on appearances and knowledge as such. This third element can be either one of the two extremes (knowledge based on appearances or knowledge as such) or something else entirely. It seems that, according to Hegel, if transcendental idealism is taken at face value, one subscribes to the view that knowledge based in appearances grounds both itself and knowledge as such, yet Hegel's criticism is that this precisely leads to absurdity which subsequently must mean that Kant merely takes for granted either that knowledge as such grounds both itself and knowledge based in appearances or that there is another third, yet unknown, common denominator. The latter seems to align well with Kant's own thinking in the _First Critique_:

> All that seems necessary for an introduction or a preliminary is that there are two stems of human cognition, which may perhaps arise from a common but to us unknown root, namely sensibility and understanding, through the first of which objects are given to us, but through the second of which they are thought (Kant, 1998, 135/A15).

In fairness to Kant, however, more emphasis is placed on pure concepts as the argument of transcendental idealism develops. Kant, in contrast to Hume, places pure categories or pure concepts in the purview of reason such that these cannot have their validity or truth established by sensuous reality, but that, rather, they serve to establish the validity and truth of sensuous reality. There are also a number of other key concepts&mdash;called _concepts of reason_&mdash;that never directly interact with sensuous reality, such as ethical principles or the concept of world (see Kant, 1998, 394/A311). Indeed, concepts of reason are in this way genuinely unconditional. With these things in mind, the thrust of Hegel's criticism is somewhat blunted, yet his real target is the fact that transcendental idealism has invalid or weak means to establish the truth of the very tools of cognition it purports to use to establish truth _tout court_. 

The take-home message thus being that, if Hegel is right, philosophy cannot but begin with metaphysics or, if it deigns to begin elsewhere, such as the instrument of cognition or conscious experience, be forced to take for granted a bad one.

### Logic as Non-Metaphysical

What is crucially omitted in typical discussions concerning logic is its state with regards to reality. Logic is not usually understood to exist in the same way a tree or a squirrel exists (i.e. a _thing_), and Hegel admits that logic does not have the kind of content that comes readily available unless one thinks about it carefully. However, this is not due to the nature of logic as much as it is with how it is being used. "Scattered in fixed determinations and thus not held together in organic unity, they are dead forms and the spirit which is their vital concrete unity does not reside in them" (Hegel, 2010, 27/21.32). While the language here is somewhat lofty, the underlying point is clear: when logic is considered merely as a settled structure, it is not considered how its many forms and patterns hang together, and especially how they are understood vis-à-vis the thinking mind, which leaves logic immutable and insubstantial. These features of logic&mdash;when formally considered&mdash;become brittle and arbitrary when the full weight of the self-critical, demand of freedom is brought to bear. 

This non-metaphysical, or formal, logic must continually seek a content outside of itself in order to become something meaningful. Formal logic must deal with objects of the world if it is to be determine something substantial, such as how various natural things behave. But Hegel's claim is that logic _does_ have a content of its own; it does have something internally meaningful&mdash;at a minimum _it is_ the concrete unity that holds together all the fixed, pre-established structures, be they syllogisms, propositions or other categories. It is not the fault of logic, Hegel says, that it seems empty, but it is, rather, the way in which it is being understood which is empty (Hegel, 2010, 28/21.32). If one begins to inspect how these various logical forms are connected, one has already begun to leave behind logic as fixed patterns with the implicit understanding that an integral unity exists.
